                    <p>In my last internship, I also learnt Blockchain development using Solidity, the programming language powering Ethereum's Smart Contracts. It is quite refreshing as security is one of the first considerations when coding the contracts. Security vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy (i.e. double spending) are very costly to both the business and the users</p>
